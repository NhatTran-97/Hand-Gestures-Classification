## Overview

This project is designed to recognize hand gestures using a deep learning model built with PyTorch. It leverages computer vision techniques and neural networks to classify hand gestures into predefined categories. The system can be integrated into various real-time applications such as controlling devices via hand gestures.

## Features

- **Dataset Loading**: Custom dataset loader for handling CSV files containing hand gesture data.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A neural network built with fully connected layers, including ReLU activation functions, dropout layers, and batch normalization.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Training using cross-entropy loss with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Generated confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
- **Classification Report**: Generated classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Training and testing on GPU (if available) for faster performance.
